**Implement next-generation neural networks to build powerful GAN models using Python**

## What is this book about?
With continuously evolving research and development, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are the next big thing in the field of deep learning. This book highlights the key improvements in GANs over generative models and guides in making the best out of GANs with the help of hands-on examples.


This book covers the following exciting features:
Implement PyTorch's latest features to ensure efficient model designing 
Get to grips with the working mechanisms of GAN models 
Perform style transfer between unpaired image collections with CycleGAN 
Build and train 3D-GANs to generate a point cloud of 3D objects 
Create a range of GAN models to perform various image synthesis operations 
Use SEGAN to suppress noise and improve the quality of speech audio

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
    # Derivative with respect to w3
    d_w3 = np.matmul(np.transpose(self.x2), delta)
    # Derivative with respect to b3
    d_b3 = delta.copy()
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This GAN book is for machine learning practitioners and deep learning researchers looking to get hands-on guidance in implementing GAN models using PyTorch.
